# Codex

A next-generation writing application designed for a calm, focused, and powerful creative experience.

## Guiding Principles

Codex is being built with a clear vision for the user experience. All features and design choices are measured against these three core principles:

* **Calm:** A clean, minimalist, and distraction-free interface.
* **Focused:** The writing experience is paramount. UI elements use progressive disclosure to stay out of the user's way until needed.
* **Powerful:** Complex features are translated into simple, intuitive user actions.

## âœ¨ Current Features (Client-Side)

This repository contains the client-side implementation of Codex. All data is currently mocked in the client's state and is not persistent.

* **Project & Document Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Rename, Delete) for both projects and documents.
* **Persistent & Responsive Layout:** A collapsible and resizable sidebar that remembers its size and state across sessions.
* **Context-Aware Navigation:** The sidebar and breadcrumbs intelligently update based on the user's location within the app.
* **Dynamic Views:** Seamlessly switch between a project dashboard, a project-specific document list, and the main editor.
* **Rich Text Editor:** Powered by TipTap, featuring a Notion-style floating bubble menu for text formatting.
* **User Preferences:** A settings system (persisted to `localStorage`) to control UI features, such as switching between a bubble menu and a static toolbar.
* **Theming:** Full Light, Dark, and System theme support.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* npm or a compatible package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
